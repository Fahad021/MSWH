# Guidelines for contributors

The MSWH software is open to contributions from the coder community around the world. 

The contributors should comply with the 
[University of California Standards of Ethical Conduct](https://policy.ucop.edu/doc/1100172/EthicalValuesandConduct).

The contribution can be a bug fix, an improvement to existing features, or a fully new feature.

If you wish to contribute any of these please follow this workflow:

* Create an new issue in the [MSWH issue tracker](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/MSWH/issues) that briefly describes your intended contribution
* Await response from a person responsible for code maintenance
* Discuss whether there is a need to address this issue and ways in which the issue should best be addressed
* Once agreement is reached on how to address the issue, develop the feature, fix the bug or improve the code
* When you are happy with your code that addresses the issue, after you confirm that all tests are passing, create a [pull request](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/MSWH/compare) against the `master` branch
* Notify the person that was discussing the issue with you using `@githubname` that the feature/fix/improvement is now ready for review
* Conduct iterations of receiving review and addressing it until the reviewer approves the PR.
* The reviewer will then thank you and merge the PR
* Now you can start utilizing the updated code!

In addition, if you have question on how to best apply the existing code for your particular purpose, you may pose that question using the [MSWH issue tracker](https://github.com/LBNL-ETA/MSWH/issues).

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our open source MSWH repository!
